# Find A Food Bank

## Project Description

Find A Food Bank is a website where people can go to find accurate and up-to-date information about local food banks and similar hunger-relief organizations in their area. Participating organizations are encouraged to provide and keep up with their own respective information on the website to ensure that the site is reliable. I will be providing all the data to get the site started though.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a person who requires assistance with acquiring food stuffs I’d like there to be a website where I can go to find accurate and up-to-date information about different assistance programs including food banks and free kitchens.

- As a person who doesn’t want to sort through old, irrelevant or confusing data I’d like the website to provide some general information about each food bank. They should each have how long they’ve been in operation, the hours and dates of operation, what type of food they have, how many people they serve a day, etc. For example, is this place just a church closet with a few cans and dried goods or is it a full kitchen with a fridge and freezer?

- As a person who may not have regular access to the Internet or the website I’d like to be sure that the information is reliable whenever I look at it so I can still get food even without my own computer.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a person who requires assistance but still has regular access to the Internet I’d like to be able to sign up for email updates about when my selected food banks may have updated their information or have special events.

- As a person who wants to help those in need around me I'd like the ability to donate to a food bank and know that the money is all going to the right place.
